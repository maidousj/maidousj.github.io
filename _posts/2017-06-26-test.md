## Summary:

Copy from one of my memos for test.

### catalog
- [Module 2](#Module2)
- [Module 3](#Module 3)
- [Module 4](#Module 4)

##### Module2

$a^2_1$
> 在VLDB2016上的一个教程

为了保证数据的可用性，一个统计数据库必须要泄漏一些关于个体的信息

> A vast majority of records in a database of size n can be reconstructed when $n\log(n)^2$ queriesare answered by a statistical database ...
> ... even if each answer has been arbitrarilyaltered to have up to o(√n) error

——— Dinur-Nissim PODS 2003

也就是说，对于（在同一个数据库上的）queries的数量是有限制的。



##### Module 3

对于表格式的数据库查询的回复

Offline (batch)

- Entire W given as input, answers computed in batch

Online (adaptive)

- W is sequence q1, q2, ... that arrives online
- Adaptive: analyst’s choice for qi can depend onanswers 𝑎1, ... , 𝑎𝑖−1

Answering linear queries online is strictly harder than answering them offline [BSU16]



数据复杂性和查询的复杂性

Query：

- histograms, range queries, marginals, counting queries, linear queries	

Solution variants: query answers vs.synthetic data

Two high-level approaches to solving problem

1. Direct:
   – Output of the algorithm is list of query answers
2. Synthetic data:
   – Algorithm constructs a synthetic dataset D’, which canbe queried directly by analyst
   – Analyst can pose additional queries on D’(though answers may not be accurate)
